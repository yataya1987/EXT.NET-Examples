    Bin and HtmlBin Overview

    The Bin and HtmlBin features helps a developer to organize the things modularly.

    The Bin is a collection for Ext.NET controls.

    The main difference between Bin and Items:

        - The Bin controls are not rendered (client side to DOM) automatically;
        - The Bin controls don't participate in the layout logic.

    The HtmlBin is for raw HTML.
